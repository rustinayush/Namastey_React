<!-- // How Browser knows what is createElement , getElementById and appendChild

answer-- Due to javascript Engine , it is very powerful it knows how js terminologies... /
because they are part of the DOM (Document Object Model) API, which is built into all modern web browsers. 

These function are implemented in javascript by the browser, and every modern browser comes with built-in 
javascript Engine that can execute javascipt code and interact with the DOM.
